AMUSEMENT PARK DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Problem statement <br>
<br>
An Amusement Park has a Name. People visit the site and sign up with
their name, email Id, and Phone number. There are various types of
rides in the amusement park-like Adventure rides, water rides,
trampoline rides, and snow rides. Visitors can book any of these rides.
Visitors visit this Amusement Park, they first sign up and then book the
tickets, while booking their date of arrival, the rides they are booking
and the number of people they are booking for are noted. There is a
different login for the admin from where he can manage the website.
From admin login employees can be managed, employees can be
added, deleted and their salary can be updated. All the rides can be
viewed from the admin login, also the visitors and total count of visitors
can be checked.
